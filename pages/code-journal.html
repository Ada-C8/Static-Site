          The first non-holiday monday of the new year is where my little programming journey begins, at Epicodus. Epicodus is a Portland-based bootcamp with different tracks to choose from, with it's defining characterist its focus on pair programming. I was in the C# track, and, with one of my close friends, started a few rough weeks of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

          Turns out pair programming as the only means of education does not jive with me! Although I found the material at Epicodus interesting, it was very quickly obvious the teaching style just did not work for my learning style. On February 13, I left the program.

        <p>
          On February 16, I applied to Ada.

          It's the middle of April. I check my email. I see it's from Ada Developers Academy. I read it. My heart stopped.

          I. WAS. ACCEPTED!

          On May 12, Jamey and I have our wedding reception with friends and family from around the world. It was the second-most magical day of my life, the first being our actual elopment last August at the Seattle Municipal Courthouse.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jamey has been my number one supporter in my education and pursuit of a career in programming. He has taken on so many extra responsibilities and costs for us to make sure I can get through this program.

          It's finally here! The program has finally started! I was very nervous for the first day and could hardly sleep. As soon as I stepped in, though, I knew I was in the right place. The folks around me were immediately welcoming, even when they looked just as nervous as I felt. There was a buzz among the new students.

          After several years in coffee, I finally quit my barista job. I just couldn't handle fulltime school and partime work.
        </p>
        <p>
          I love coffee. I love the history of it, the science of it, the social and community aspects of it. From growing to harvesting to processing to roasting to brewing, I love it all.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dang it, though. I am <strong>so glad</strong> to be out of the service industry! <strong>So glad</strong> to be able to focus on school.
