      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <article>
        <p>
          I'm the kind of person that believes in life-long learning.  That's why I chose to study software development.  I expect that throughout my career I will be learning new and difficult things.  This is what I live for: the moments where I know that my knowledge isn't sufficient, but my abilty and willingness to learn will get me there.

          Before I studied programming, I was a chemist.  The skills needed to be an effective scientist also happen to be the same skills that make an excellent developer.  The ability to objectively observe, curiosity, the ability to be logical, and skeptical are important when it comes to all aspects of coding. When I am given a challenging task, I use the scientific method to solve it.  First, a hypothesis must be formed. The hypothesis is tested. Then the outcome is observed.  Using this method, most difficult tasks can be segmented into approachable problems.
