        <h3> Bertha Knight Landes </h3>
        <p>
          Our first and (so far) only female Mayor. She lost to a guy with no experience who refused to debate here and called her a "hostile and infuriated woman." Good thing times have changed!

        <h3> Hiram Gill </h3>
        <p>
          Recalled as Mayor due to his involvement in an attempt to open a 500 room brothel in Beacon Hill. Ran again. Was re-elected. Twice.

        <h3> Gordon Hirabayashi </h3>
        <p>
          A student at UW during WWII, he was one of just three Japanese Americans who refused to go the internment camps in 1942. There's a play about him called "Hold These Truths."

        <h3> Emma Ray </h3>
        <p>
          She was an all-around tough lady who helped all kinds of people. I'd like to write something about her but there was already this excellent article in Crosscut, so read that instead.

        <h3> Fred Anhalt </h3>
        <p>
          He designed the building I live in. He liked doors and courtyards and wanted every apartment to be different from every other. Which is cool, though confusing for pizza delivery.
