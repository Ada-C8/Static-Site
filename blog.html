      <h2>Day 4</h2>
      <h3>09.12.17</h3>
      <p>Let your imagination be your guide. Don't forget to tell these special people in your life just how special they are to you. Everybody needs a friend.</p>

      <p>A happy cloud. It's cold, but it's beautiful. Trees live in your fan brush, but you have to scare them out. There is no right or wrong - as long as it makes you happy and doesn't hurt anyone. You have to make almighty decisions when you're the creator. Poor old tree.</p>

      <p>Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. Think about a cloud. Just float around and be there. If there's two big trees invariably sooner or later there's gonna be a little tree.</p>

      <p>See there how easy that is. You're meant to have fun in life. Don't kill all your dark areas - you need them to show the light. This is the way you take out your frustrations. There's not a thing in the world wrong with washing your brush. Don't be bashful drop me a line.</p>

      <h2>Day 3</h2>
      <h3>08.30.17</h3>
      <p>You want your tree to have some character. Make it special. Use what happens naturally, don't fight it. And I know you're saying, 'Oh Bob, you've done it this time.' And you may be right. Anyone can paint. Let's put some happy little bushes on the other side now. Here we're limited by the time we have.</p>

      <p>Learn when to stop. Let's put some happy little clouds in our world. See how easy it is to create a little tree right in your world. Anytime you learn something your time and energy are not wasted. All you have to learn here is how to have fun. If you've been in Alaska less than a year you're a Cheechako.</p>

      <p>Only God can make a tree - but you can paint one. Decide where your cloud lives. Maybe he lives right in here. There we go. Just relax and let it flow. That easy. What the devil. Let your imagination be your guide.</p>

      <p>And just raise cain. Every time you practice, you learn more. Isn't that fantastic? You can just push a little tree out of your brush like that. You don't have to be crazy to do this but it does help. We can always carry this a step further. There's really no end to this.</p>

      <h2>Day 2</h2>
      <h3>08.08.17</h3>
      <p>I'm gonna start with a little Alizarin crimson and a touch of Prussian blue We must be quiet, soft and gentle. We need dark in order to show light. Exercising the imagination, experimenting with talents, being creative; these things, to me, are truly the windows to your soul.</p>

      <p>We're trying to teach you a technique here and how to use it. You don't have to spend all your time thinking about what you're doing, you just let it happen. And just raise cain.</p>

      <p>Everybody's different. Trees are different. Let them all be individuals. Just make little strokes like that. You can do anything your heart can imagine. There isn't a rule. You just practice and find out which way works best for you.</p>

      <p>Paint anything you want on the canvas. Create your own world. You've got to learn to fight the temptation to resist these things. Just let them happen. This is truly an almighty mountain. In nature, dead trees are just as normal as live trees. See there, told you that would be easy. Let's have a happy little tree in here.</p>
