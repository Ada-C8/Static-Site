<!-- Baseline

Create an index.html that has the necessary meta information to link a stylesheet called styles.css.
Add a <header>, <footer>, and <nav> to your index.html.
Create a portfolio.html page that also includes styles.css.
Include a link to both pages in the <nav> on both pages.
Primary Requirements

Add pages to your static site. The requirement is a minimum of four pages. These pages should be:
index.html
portfolio.html: information about the projects you've completed at Ada (or elsewhere) with links (to github repo), descriptions, images, etc.
code-journal.html or hobby-blog.html: article or blog style posts about either your journey/observations about programming or a hobby you enjoy.
about.html: some information about you, your interests, background or similar. Whatever you're comfortable sharing.
The site should follow best practices including:
All markup should be semantic, with consideration of hierarchy and accessibility.
CSS should be concise and well formatted
Images and stylesheets should be kept in their own folders, called images and stylesheets, respectively. -->
