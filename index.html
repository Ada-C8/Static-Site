      <h2>hello there!</h2>
      <p>
        I'm Kate Spitzer.<br /><br />
      </p>
      <p>
        I was born in Boston, raised in Seattle, and spent several years living in New York City working in the fashion industry. Nowadays I'm living back home in the Pacific Northwest with my wife and two cats. When I'm not writing code I can be found hiking, playing video games, cooking, eating, or out in the city hunting down the best new restaurant/bar/vintage furniture store.<br /><br />
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm currently a full-time student in Cohort 8 of <a href="https://adadevelopersacademy.org/">Ada Developers Academy</a>.
