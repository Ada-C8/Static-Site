    <h2>About Me - Work in Progress</h2>
    <p>My name is Stefanie (I surmised you've figured this out already), but I tend to go by Stef preferably and never Steffie or however you spell it.  I hate talking about myself in the third person because I find it to be ridiculous.  Thus you get this version.  Currently I am a software development student at Ada Developers Academy in Seattle.  I live downtown in an eclectic apartment that has a great view of the sound, with my cat Hedwig, my bettas Miso and Swedish, and a lot of plants. My free time is generally spent trying to complete homework and eating.  My favourite colour is green and I have a billion other hobbies that I shall talk about some other time.</p>
