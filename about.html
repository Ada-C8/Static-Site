              Originally from California, Jocelyn is a transplant who has
              been living in Seattle for 3 years. Although she sometimes
              misses the sun, she loves the Pacific Northwest and fights
              seasonal affect disorder by taking her vitamins. She began
              coding a few years ago when she took a Java course on Codecademy
              on a dare. She is currently a software development student at
              Ada Developer's Academy.
