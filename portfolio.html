			<h3>Meowspace</h3>
			
			<p>

			<h3>Hotel</h3>
			
			<p>
				Hotel was a project designed to implement the ideas of modules and classes.
				The code I wrote allows guests to book a reservation, an allows hotel staff
				to reserve rooms if they need to. It also handles all of the logic of 
				ensuring rooms are not double booked.

			<h3>Solar System</h3>
			
			<p>
				Solar System was a project designed to implement the ideas of classes, and 
				instance variables. We created Planet classes and added them to our Solar System
				class. We then setup checks to access and verify various attributes about each planet.
