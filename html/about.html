          About Me
        </h2>
        <p>
          Newly embarking on a career in software development, I am a student at Ada Developer's Academy, Cohort 8. I thoroughly enjoy and believe in continuous learning and self-development. This makes software development a fitting path for me.
        </p>

        <p>
          In addition to my knowledge of programming languages - Ruby, HTML, CSS - I also speak several human languages: English, Spanish, French, Italian, some German, and working on Mandarin.
        </p>

        <p>
          Professionally, I also have experience in management, sales, teaching, and marketing. I have a BA in Sociology from McGill University, Montreal, Canada.
        </p>

        <p>
          While I am originally from the USA, I lived abroad for 12 years after completing my primary education. I strongly believe in the beauty and benefit of diversity, and enjoy working with people from all backgrounds.
        </p>

        <p>
          Health and wellness are of utmost importance for me. I try to maintain a healthy balance in life, eat well, and be active.  I recently became a certified yoga instructor, and am generally happy to partake in most sporting activities, especially hiking, bouldering, paddleboarding, kayaking, biking, rollerblading, and skiing
        </p>

        <p>
          Finally, traveling is one of my greatest passions.
