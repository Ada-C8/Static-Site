      Originally from Chicago, IL, I grew up playing ice hockey and eating loads of deep dish pizza.

      I received my Undergraduate and Master's degree from Occidental College in Los Angeles (where I was also Oswald the Tiger, Occidental's mascot).

      I taught scuba diving in Belize and then high school English in Seattle until I discovered @ Ada Developer's Academy!
