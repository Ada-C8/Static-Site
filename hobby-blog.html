        The musicals that leave us kind of staggering on our feet are the ones that really reach for a lot. ----Lin-Manuel Miranda

        <h3> Sound of Music </h3>

            One of the most uplifting sound tracks till date. Rogers and Hammerstein were well known for musicals in the 60s. "I have confidence in sunshine, <a href="https://www.scribd.com/doc/301476059/I-Have-Confidence-Sheet-Musicsongsheet">I have confidence in rain</a>. I have confidence that they will put me to the test and believe it or not I have confidence in me." If that isn’t a pep talk relevant to now, I don’t know what is.  Maria singing to herself on her way to her first job.

            The ability to set such beautiful music against the backdrop of a tragic time in history is commendable.

            A very funny story on class, manners and how we are judged by our accents and backgrounds. It is also a story of personal branding and a lack of identity.

            A man able to clean up a guttersnipe and present her months later to the society by changing her accent and dresscode. How many such guttersnipes (impostors) do we have in society today… <a href="http://www.onlinesheetmusic.com/i-could-have-danced-all-night-p289487.aspx">I could have danced all night</a>..beautiful!.

            Subtle yet exciting film on slavery, colonization and gender politics. A king with 100 wives and concubines has to seek council of a ‘lowly’ woman to manage strained relationships with the English. She does not fit the preferred role of sex object. How much has changed..?

            Yet again, another Rogers and Hammerstein collaboration. The lyrics of the songs are so clever, its hard not to smile when singing. "Whenever I am afraid, I strike a careless pose and no one ever knows <a href="http://www.musicnotes.com/sheetmusic/mtd.asp?ppn=MN0106644">I am afraid</a>. Make believe your’re brave and the trick will take you far. You will be as brave as you make believe you are.” Anna informing her son of how to maneuver palace life and politics on the boat to Siam /Thailand.

          Genius! Setting classic <a href="http://www.musicnotes.com/sheetmusic/mtd.asp?ppn=MN0122198">Motown</a> to a modern musical. Soundtrack is hard to get hold of on cd and itunes! Actually if Fraulein Maria was born in the 1960s she would be Dolores.
