          <h1>My Child is Another Me? Object Inheritance</h1>
          <time>August 24, 2017</time>
          <p>Of birds and children, today we learned about what it means for objects to have an is-a relationship via object inheritance. Super!</p>
          <p>Inheritance is a way to define another instance of a class but with attributes/functionality specific to it.</p>
          <p>In our class example we described how Hawks and Penguins are a type of Bird. In this case, Bird is the parent class or base class. And Hawk and Penguins are inheriting traits from Bird, making it a child or subclass.</p>
          <p>As a base class, Bird is more general compared to its children. All Birds can caw, therefore both Hawk and Penguin can both caw.</p>
