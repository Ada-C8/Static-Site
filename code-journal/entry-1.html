          <h1>Automated Testing</h1>
          <time>August 18, 2017</time>
          <p>It's almost the end of the 2nd week at Ada and things are far from slowing down!</p>
          <p>It's funny how in the X amount of months I spent learning programming, we've already covered those topics in just the last week.</p>
          <p>Today we learned how to do automated testing using Minitest and Test-Driven Development.</p>
          <p>Test-Driven Development is done by writing bare minimum tests for each functionality you want your code to have FIRST and after seeing the error, only then writing the implementation of your code. That's why it's called "Test-Driven" Development.</p>
          <p>You alternate between writing tests and writing code. But it's important to look at the errors, no matter how jarring they may be.</p>
