          <h1>Fruity Loops: Enumerables and Mixins</h1>
          <time>August 29, 2017</time>
          <p>Once, there was a person that said "you know, I wish we could accomplish more tasks with loops." So they took the existing Ruby code, mixin' some Ruby magic, and thus Enumerables were born.</p>
          <p>I took a quarter of learning Java during undergrad once before becoming an Ada student. When using loops, my selection was very limited: for-loops & while-loops. That's it.</p>
          <p>So imagine my surprise when we started learning Ruby and there were all these neat loops like: each, times, on top of while and for loops (the latter, rarely used and instead replaced by the times loop)</p>
          <p>And on top of these loops, there were also loops that could even edit the contents of your collection by passing in a conditional. These loops, we've already used but never placed a specific name on them aside from "loops". They were each_loop, map, inject, and an array of others (pun intended?)</p>
          <p>I had only seen these loops used on StackOverflow searches and could barely understand that they did the task I was looking for a solution to before copy-pasting it onto my code. These special loops are a part of a Mixin called Enumerables.</p>
