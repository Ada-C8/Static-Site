      <h3>Other random menu generators:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li> <a href="http://www.brooklynbarmenus.com/"> Brooklynbar menus</a> is the most similar to the one I created, but adds a price to items.
        </li>
        <li>  <a href= "https://projectsanctuary.com/silvias_super_menu_generator.htm"> Silvia's Super Menu Generator</ahref></a> creates a single 5 star menu item with all the neceessary surpulatives to make it truly 5 star
          <blockquote>
            Stewed stew of locally shot groundhog
            on a reef of shredded baby potatoes,
            served with a hot chillie pepper dashi
            and two spherical pieces of greengage ravioli,
            topped with a French inspired bacon nibble.
          </blockquote>
        </li>
        <li>  <a href= "http://www.reciperoulette.tv/"> Recipe Roulette</ahref></a> is similar to a random menu generator, but instead suggest what you should make for dinner and supplies a recipie.  It also accepts limited user input to narrow down the options... which makes it totally unlike the other examples in being just a little bit useful.</li>

    <h3>Lightning bugs and implicit bias</h3>
    While researching my lighting talk on lightning bugs I came across the following <a href = http://ncase.me/fireflies/>website</a> which presents an interactive model for how some species of fireflies syncronise their flashing patterns. It was created by Nicky Case and the sorce code is available on <a href ="https://github.com/ncase/fireflies" >github</a>. I admire how the user can change the variables in the model and change the behavior of the fireflies. I look forward to being able to create something like this in the future.
    While investigating the sorce code, I found a link to another project Nicky created on <a href="http://ncase.me/polygons/">implicit bias</a>.  It is described as  "A story of how harmless choices can make a harmful world."  I think is just the kind of thing that Adies would like, though it is a little bit too long to be useable to explain implicit bias to people who are not already aware of it.
