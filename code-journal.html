              <h2>Something new is happening...</h2>
              <p>
              On Monday, two days from now, I begin classes at Ada Developer's Academy (ADA). While I cannot tell you how excited I am, I can tell you that I've looked at my acceptance email every week since April just to verify that I was accepted. This is despite the fact that I've been to study sessions and have been completing homework assignments for months. After a year and a half of teaching myself to code in my spare time, I get to be in a community of like-minded people who for whatever reason, decided to change up their career by going back to school for another year. It feels life-changing, but it also feels like my head is going to hurt a lot.

              I moved to Seattle in the hope of making a better life for myself than the one I left behind. It's been wonderful living in the Pacific Northwest, but it's also been incredibly hard working nightshift at an admin job for the past three years. For the first time in a long time, I get to dedicate my full-time occupation to one of my passions: coding. It's going to be amazing. I cannot wait.

              <h2>Week 2 Update</h2>
              <p>
              I am struggling because I'm learning something new and it has nothing to do with what I am capable of achieving. I'm pushing myself to learn new concepts and it can feel like I'm pushing my brain to its limits. It can make me doubt myself, but it can't take away what I have already achieved: I am here. I am learning alongside an amazing group of incredibly bright and supportive people who feel this same internal struggle. I don't have to be alone in this because I am definitely not alone.
              </p>
              <p>What to improve upon:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Ask for help - reach out to my peers and my mentor/tutoring network more. 10 times more.</li>
                <li>Re-watch the recorded lectures when I'm confused </li>
                <li>Stop doubting what I can do</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Other thoughts:</p>
              <ul>

                <li>Coffee is my best friend</li>
                <li>Picking blackberries is a great way to end the day</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Sticky notes on my keyboard</p>
              <ul>
